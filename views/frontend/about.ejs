              <h3>Jack Lee</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Maybe you will find your story has something in common with mine.</p>

            <p>I came to study at Monash University in Melbourne in 1993. Having graduated, I spent the first 10 years
              of my career back in Malaysia, where I was born, and Singapore working for OCBC Bank and Capgemini.</p>

            <p>In 2004, I came back and settled down in Sydney with my family and continued my corporate life with
              Optus, Westpac, and Macquarie Bank. Another decade went by.</p>

            <p>In 20 years timeat an office, I was longing for change. Change for my own fulfillment and my family. I
              founded an online company, a language school, two IT companies and invested in some private firms.</p>

            <p>I came across business brokering in 2012. A year later, I finally brought an end to my corporate life
              and became a dedicated business broker.</p>

            <p>It is such a privilege that I witnessed some profoundly inspiring stories of my buyers and experienced
              the utmost pleasure from facilitating their successes.</p>

            <p>A Chinese lady bought a managed café where she secured her permanent residency while everything around
              including English was unfamiliar to her.</p>

            <p>An Indian office worker quitted his job, exactly as I did years ago, and devoted himself to his passion,
              a lovely party shop.</p>

            <p>A white collar managed to find a way out by joining a franchise chain when his career was full of
              uncertainty in the face of a depressed industry.</p>

            <p>A young mum found the balance between her kids and her pursuit for a hospitality business by owning a
              managed takeaway restaurant.</p>

            <p>It was not intended. But as an Asian immigrant myself, I happened to have the opportunities to serve a
              great many buyers from Asian backgrounds mostly for their very first business acquisitions in Australia.</p>

            <p>I have made it my mission to enable you the best route heading straight and safely to a great business.</p>

              <h3>Rooney Zhou</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Just like most students from China, I was once struggling to get the degree while working several
              part-time jobs for a living. I also had a few internships to decorate a compelling resume.</p>

            <p>Having graduated in 2014 from USyd, luckily I was offered a job at last while most of my fellows were
              not asfar as I knew. I didn't have many choices and debuting at a multinational conglomerate was not too
              bad either.</p>

            <p>Fair pay and involvement in some real projects. It was quite productive for 2 years until I realized my
              circumstances wouldn't have much surprise in the foreseeable future. Income wise and fulfillment wise, I
              saw how far I could go as an employee who never had the autonomy that I was longing for.</p>

            <p>However, I thought of no other possibility other than hanging in there since there were still too many
              of my fellows and the graduating students who wanted to squeeze in. I could never outsmart them.</p>

            <p>Then I hopped into business brokering in 2016 given my background in promoting Australian manufacturers
              towards distributors and investors in China. Surprisingly it was, in fact, my clients who substantiated
              the possibilities that I had thought could never be mine.</p>

            <p>A young man at his 20s took over a convenience store working there for himself and reaping more income
              than he could earn from any other part-time job then.</p>

            <p>A fresh Chinese graduate started up his first ever business via acquiring a longstanding florist in a
              major shopping centre.</p>

            <p>They were just like most of the first-time buyers with a tight budget and least experience. Not everyone
              was born with a phenomenal talent or a silver spoon in the mouth.</p>

            <p>Inspired by their courage and creativity, I strive to identify the wealth of possibilities for more
              people like them and formulate the securest route marching forward.</p>
